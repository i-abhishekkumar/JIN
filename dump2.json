A proviso below\nsub-section (2) is inserted to provide that\nwhere the original arbitration agreement or\ncertified copy thereof is not available with the\nparty who apply under sub-section (1), and is\nretained by the other party, such party shall\nfile a copy of the arbitration agreement along\nwith application under sub-section (1) praying\nto the court to call upon the other party to\nproduce the original arbitration agreement or\nits duly certified copy before the court. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is\ninarbitrable, the court where a suit is\npending, will refuse to refer the parties to\narbitration, under Section 8 of the Act,\neven if the parties might have agreed\nupon arbitration as the forum for\nsettlement of such disputes.\u201d\n\n11, Thereafter, this Court in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading\nCorpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, laid down a fourfold test for determining\nwhen the subject-matter of a dispute in an arbitration agreement\n\nis not arbitrable.",
