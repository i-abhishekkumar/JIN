The High Court was\nof the opinion that since the appellants had claimed that\nthe complainant assembled only 28,995 bicycles, which\nwould make them liable to pay only an amount of Rs.35\nlakhs, but instead the appellants had paid an amount of\nRs.62 lakhs which shows that the actual number of\nbicycles which were assembled by the complainant was\nmuch more than 28,995 bicycles, as claimed by the\nappellants and therefore, the appellants had an intention\nto cheat the complainant right from the beginning.
